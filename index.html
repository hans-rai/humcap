                                <strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> "UNFPA in Bangladesh is committed to investing in climate adaptation and working across the nexus, and is spearheading many important initiatives that facilitate preparedness, early disaster response, resilient early recovery, and, in Cox's Bazar, area-based responses that include host communities. The current CPD underscores this commitment, as does UNFPA's innovative programming such as cash and voucher assistance, anticipatory action and decentralized procurement. However, there is no specific articulation in the CPD or in specific country programme guidance on what the nexus entails for the CO."<br><br>
                                <strong>Conclusion 4:</strong> "UNFPA support has led to significant increases in utilization of a range of SRH, GBV and A&Y services in Cox's Bazar and to a lesser, but still important, extent in sudden-onset disasters over the evaluation period. UNFPA has also improved the quality of these services over time to better address the needs of specific populations, such as PWD and third gender populations. Moreover, UNFPA has sought to maximize efficiency in delivery of services through integrated approaches. However, despite UNFPA's strong relationship with the Government of Bangladesh, sustainability of services presents ongoing and future challenges, particularly in relation to accelerating funding shortfalls affecting Cox's Bazar and short project cycles for disasters."

                                <strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> "UNFPA is widely recognized as a key UN partner in the Rohingya refugee response and in response to sudden-onset natural disasters in Bangladesh. Its facilitation of SRH, GBV, and A&Y coordination and programming has positioned UNFPA as a leader in these sectors. However, funding for these sectors remains consistently lower than other humanitarian sectors. This presents significant challenges to coverage of needs, particularly in disaster response. UNFPA has used and continues to diversify funding mechanisms to expand coverage, such as through IFI funding in Cox's Bazar."

                                <strong>Conclusion 3:</strong> "UNFPA plays a crucial role in data collection in humanitarian response, from assessments to targeted surveys to information management to programme monitoring, and utilizes data to support the wider humanitarian community and to improve UNFPA's own programmatic response. However, UNFPA's data experts (including population data staff) are not mobilized to their full capacity to support data collection and management for disaster preparedness and response. This includes pre-disaster consultations with affected populations, developing a common beneficiary database for anticipatory action (and joint activities with other agencies), and with the MISP calculator, which requires updating. Data collection could also focus more strategically on capturing the impact of services, in order to better illustrate the life-saving nature of UNFPA-supported interventions, particularly related to GBV."

UNFPA has also improved the quality of these services over time to better address the needs of specific populations, such as PWD and third gender populations. Moreover, UNFPA has sought to maximize efficiency in delivery of services through integrated approaches. However, despite UNFPA's strong relationship with the Government of Bangladesh, sustainability of services presents ongoing and future challenges, particularly in relation to accelerating funding shortfalls affecting Cox's Bazar and short project cycles for disasters."

                            F. UNFPA HRD should support learning from CO's globally (including Bangladesh) to develop guidance on working at the nexus, not least as an important corporate strategy for accessing a greater variety of funds in humanitarian response, but also to elevate UNFPA's position as a nexus agency. This could also include finalizing specific guidance on Anticipatory Action.

The current CPD underscores this commitment, as does UNFPA's innovative programming such as cash and voucher assistance, anticipatory action and decentralized procurement. However, there is no specific articulation in the CPD or in specific country programme guidance on what the nexus entails for the CO."

                                <strong>Conclusion 3:</strong> "UNFPA plays a crucial role in data collection in humanitarian response, from assessments to targeted surveys to information management to programme monitoring, and utilizes data to support the wider humanitarian community and to improve UNFPA's own programmatic response. However, UNFPA's data experts (including population data staff) are not mobilized to their full capacity to support data collection and management for disaster preparedness and response. This includes pre-disaster consultations with affected populations, developing a common beneficiary database for anticipatory action (and joint activities with other agencies), and with the MISP calculator, which requires updating. Data collection could also focus more strategically on capturing the impact of services, in order to better illustrate the life-saving nature of UNFPA-supported interventions, particularly related to GBV."
